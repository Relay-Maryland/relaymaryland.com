## The Relay Improvement Association

The Relay Improvement Association was established in the 1990s by a group of residents who had a great love for the beauty and history of the community.

There are several octogenarians who grew up in the Relay and St.Denis and still live here. There are some families with several generations living in the Relay and St. Denis. 

Association activities have included Relay Day, Wine and Cheese, St. Patricks Day celebration, community yard sales and community clean up, and many more. 

Association projects include restoration of the World War I service banner, new windows for the town hall, commemorative bricks, routine maintenance and upkeep of the town hall. A newsletter has been delivered to the community several times a year for many years notifying residents of upcoming events, any information that might be helpful, and some history. 

Voting Membership is available to adults ( 18 years of age or older) living within or owning property within the boundaries of the Relay Improvement Association (RIA). Boundaries are the Patapsco River to the South, Route 1 and Herbert Run to the East, 1-95 to the North, and Selford Avenue above 1-95 to the West, including homes on both sides of Gun Road to the State Park property line. 

RIA membership provides the right to vote on matters presented at the RIA General Meetings and discounts to RIA sponsored events. RIA members in good standing will receive a discount on all Town Hall rentals.
