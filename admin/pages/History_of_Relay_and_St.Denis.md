Relay was the first town created by a U.S. railroad in 1830.
The first hotel built on the B&O was the Relay House, built in 1830. The first horse-drawn passenger trains changed horses here for the final six miles to Ellicott's Mills.

Charles Carroll of Carrollton was the only signer of the Declaration of Independence to be on a train that stopped at Relay House.

By 1850, the Relay House was the second most passenger-generating point (second only to Ellicott City) on the B&O line between Baltimore and Wheeling, West Virginia.
During the Civil War, "Camp Relay House" was composed of a number of camps and fortifications on both sides of the Patapsco River.

In 1872, the B&O built the Viaduct Hotel, a showcase combination hotel and station at Relay overlooking the Patapsco River. It was surrounded with gardens, graveled walkways, flowers, hedges, and evergreens. It was the first hotel station in the nation built for the comfort of railway passengers.
Relay was home to one of the first volunteer fire companies in Baltimore County. In 1892, on Arlington Avenue, there was a one- room building which housed a hand-drawn fire engine. In 1910, the present two-story structure was built (Town Hall) and the hand-drawn engine was replaced by a large hose carriage and three paid firemen.
The second public library in Baltimore County, established in 1929, was also housed in the Relay Town Hall.
