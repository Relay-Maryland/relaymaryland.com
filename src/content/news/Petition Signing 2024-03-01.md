## Petition Signing-March 17th 4-7pm

Dear Relay Neighbors:

We invite you to sign a Petition opposing CZMP 1-008 & 1-009 during our "Covered Dish" on March 17th, 4-7pm at the Relay Town Hall; 1710 Arlington Avenue.

Issue CZMP 1-008 & 1-009 state that the property owner wishes to re-zone properties from RC-5 (Rural Conservation) to BM (Business) zoning. While these properties are separated by I-95; they are linked and along with Gun Road residents, Relay residents voiced their opposition to this zoning request change on February 6th during the County Planning process. This area was deemed rural conservation for some time now and for good reason. We have to band together and ensure the zoning remains intact.

Neighbors from Gun Road have submitted their petition to Councilman Pat Young's office and plan to do the same. We ask if you are like-minded that you sign this petition. If you are unable to join us this coming Sunday, please submit your opposition to [mailto:relaytownhall@gmail.com](relaytownhall@gmail.com).

Thank you for your continued support and hope to see you on Sunday.
