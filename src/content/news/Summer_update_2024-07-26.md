## RELAY SUMMER 2024 UPDATE

Greeting Relay neighbors,
Boy summer is full furnace mode and not sure about your garden but mine is taking a beating. Even
squirrels are seeking reprieve at the expense of our tomatoes. Make sure to check on neighbors,
friends occasionally and encourage hydration.
But we won’t let the heat stop us from giving you some updates.

### CZMP Item 1-008 & 1-009 Update

On June 13th a few of us spoke in front of the County Council regarding the zoning request change for
Keech Road and Viaduct Avenue. At this time, we have no update as to the County Council’s vote but
are confident that our opposition was heard as it was in February. As the CZMP process concludes in
September, I’m sure there will be an update by then with hopefully positive news.

### UPDATED WEBSITE

We have an updated website. Check it out at the following address: https://relaymaryland.com/
And please extend your appreciation to JP Courneya for his tireless effort in making this happen for us. Thanks JP!!

### GENERAL MEETING:

Next General meeting will be held on Monday, Sept. 9th @ 7:30 at the Hall. Your attendance is
requested. We do not plan to have the same format as in previous meetings as the agenda will focus
largely on replacing the roof at the hall. We ask that members be present at this meeting to cast their
important vote.

### RELAY WEEKEND

Relay weekend comes into full swing on Friday, September 20th with Wine & Cheese and concludes on Sunday,
September 22nd with RELAY DAY.
Our format has changed slightly from past operations regarding Relay Day. This year we decided to focus on the buckets of activities and assign in advance a lead for these buckets. 

**Our leads this year are as follows:**

JP Courneya: Communication lead

Barbara McClung: Community based activities/outreach

Joe Sherren & Ron Padron: Adult activities

Food & Drinks: Ed Hardester

Kids Activities & Setup/Breakdown: Frank Meek

In the coming days & weeks you may be approached by these leads to assist in making Relay Day a success once again. If you have time, please consider volunteering and thank you in advance.
