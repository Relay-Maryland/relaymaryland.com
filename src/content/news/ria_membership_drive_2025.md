## Relay Improvement Association 2025 Membership Drive

Dear Neighbors and Friends,

We’re reaching out with a heartfelt request:  Please consider becoming a member or renewing your membership to the Relay Improvement Association (RIA) in 2025! Your support helps us continue our mission to strengthen and uplift our wonderful community.

Your contributions directly fund:

Maintaining the Relay Town Hall – a cherished space for connection and collaboration.
Hosting Inspiring Speakers – who bring vital information and fresh ideas to our neighborhood.
Building Community – through social events and supportive initiatives that bring us all closer together.
As we look ahead to 2025, we’re facing rising costs, especially in utilities and insurance. To keep our efforts thriving, we’re kindly asking for a suggested membership contribution of $25 per member.   Any amount above $25 per member will be for maintenance of the hall.


If you’re unable to donate or be a member of RIA at this time, consider spreading the word about the RIA.  And if you aren’t able to make a membership dues payment consider something less than what is suggested.  It all matters and would be appreciated.  


Thanks to your past support and our careful stewardship, we’re confident that 2025 will be another amazing year!  We’ll continue to maintain our hall, host meetings, and open our doors to even more community events.  But we can’t do it without you.

Ready to make a difference?
